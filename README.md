## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

In this assignment I create the model which detects following 9 types of skin cancers,
- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

The image dataset provided is from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)

## Technologies Used
- python - version 3.11.11
- Augmentor - version 0.2.12
- tensorflow - version 2.18
- GPU - T4 GPU
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Conclusions
- Convolutional Neural Network of 2 convolutional layers and 2 dense layers is trained. It helped for multiclass classification of skin cancer using final layer of softmax classification funtion.

## Acknowledgements
I sincerly thank to Upgrad team, IITB Professors and SMEs who guided us timely to complete this assignment.
I would also like to acknowledge UpGrad tutorials videos on Convolution Neural Networks on the learning platform
